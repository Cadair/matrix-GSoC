Hydrogen is an alternative matrix client developed by Element. We want to gear Hydrogen a bit more towards personal communication, where Element Web/Desktop is geared more towards group communication. It aims to be fast, lightweight, embeddable and available on a multitude of platforms, especially mobile, by being a great Progressive Web Application. Most contributions towards this goal will be welcome, here some possible ideas:

*   Alternative login methods like SSO/social login
*   Reactions, edits, redactions or replies
*   Create an SDK from the existing code to be used inside and outside the project
*   Room management (accept invites, join public room, leave room, …)
*   Add right panel with room details, member list & member details
*   Improve room list (split by DM/rooms, show last message, …)
*   Better theming support
*   Read receipts
*   Timeline improvements
*   Improve accessibility
*   Better gesture support on touch screens
*   ...

Some of these are big topics, and any applicant wouldn’t necessarily be expected to complete the whole thing, let alone multiple items on the list.

While contributing to this project, you’ll likely also learn a lot about matrix, open source, web development, building performant software, and write code that works on a lot of browsers.


#### Before GSOC

If possibly, familiarize yourself with modern javascript, indexeddb & service workers.


#### GSOC coding starts



*   Start out building some confidence by digging into some “good-first-issue” tickets
*   Together with your mentor, pick a large topic you feel motivated by, or keep fixing bugs if that’s your thing
