Riot is a flagship Matrix client; an Apache-licensed set of communication apps for Web (React), iOS & Android. Some nice refinements that would be good GSoC projects include:

* Ability to share maps of locations! We have a PR from the community for Riot/Web (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/596) - adding to mobile would be cool too!
* Adding custom emojis to the message composer and timeline on all platforms!
* Support for using multiple accounts simultaneously.
* Quick actions on iOS for replying to notifications.
* Rich-text Editor! Riot/Web has a Rich-text Editor thanks to GSoC 2016 - why not add to the mobile platforms?
* Sending and displaying mathematics

#### Expected Results

Fun new features for mobile clients

#### Knowledge pre-req

iOS, Web dev (JavaScript and React)
