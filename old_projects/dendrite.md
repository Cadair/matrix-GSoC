[Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite) is a work in progress matrix homeserver written in Go. Being a large project there are many areas of the homeserver APIs that a GSoC project could work on, there is a [project board](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/projects/2) that tracks the current implementation status of the various APIs. A good GSoC proposal would use this and discussion with mentors and the community to find an appropriate and realistic subset of these APIs to work on during the project.

#### Expected Results

Add implementations, unit tests & integration tests for an agreed set of missing APIs for Dendrite, based on the Matrix Spec and/or taking inspiration from the legacy Python implementation.

#### Knowledge pre-req

Good knowledge of Golang and HTTP/REST APIs in general.
